# travelExpenseTracker

**travelExpenseTracker** is an Android app specifically designed for the **Queen's Student Cluster Competition Team** to efficiently track their travel expenses and incomes while participating in **SC24** ([sc24.supercomputing.org](https://sc24.supercomputing.org)) and **SC25**. The app allows users to log transactions and visualize financial data with charts. While the app provides a comprehensive list of recorded transactions, users must manually transfer these records into Excel spreadsheets to generate financial statements.

## Purpose of building this app
As the **Financial Lead** for the team, I wanted to create a tool that would simplify financial tracking for everyone involved and help me manage the team's finances more effectively. This app allows me to track each competition member's expenses and incomes during their travels. When they return, I use the recorded list of transactions to review and organize the team's budget, ensuring everything aligns with our financial goals. While the app doesn't directly generate Excel spreadsheets, it provides all the necessary details to manually create financial statements based on the recorded data.

This project reflects my dedication to keeping our team organized and financially prepared, so we can focus on achieving success at the competitions.
